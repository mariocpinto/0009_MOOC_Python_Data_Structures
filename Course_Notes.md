## Python Data Structures: Course Notes

These notes are intended to be a high level overview / quick refresher of the contents of the Coursera course 
'[Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data/)'.
This MOOC is the second of the four courses in the '[Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)'.

#### Week 1

These are the topics covered in week 1:

Week 1 introduces the content of the course and the operational details. The 'Python for Informatics' book that this course follows can be found in html format [here](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/).

In addition, the following topics are covered:
* Introduction to strings.
* Concatinating strings using `+`.
* Indexing into strings using `string[x]`.
* Determining the length of a string using `len()`.
* Accessing sub-strings (slicing strings) using `string[x:y]` - this will return the substring beginning at index x, upto - but not including - index y. Note that the index starts from 0. If you leave out x/y it represents the beginning/end of the string.
* Using `in` as an operator e.g. `'an' in 'banana'` returns `True`.
* Using `==`, `<` and `>` with strings.
* Python string methods. A list of methods can can be accessed using the `dir()` command and are documented [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
* Specific examples of string methods - `lower()`, `upper()`, `find(string_to_find)`, `replace(replace_this,with_this)`, `strip()`, `startswith(starting_string)`.
* An example of parsing text.

This week focusses on getting Python installed and is identical to week 2 of the '[Introduction to Python](https://github.com/mariocpinto/0008_MOOC_Getting_Started_with_Python)' course (and thus can be skipped).
